      <p>Hello. My name is Dani, and I'm a student at NSS learning software development.
        I enjoy creating and learning new things. I hope to excel in the UI/UX career path 
        and someday become a freelance designer whilst traveling the world.

      <h4>Apatosaurus</h4>
      <p>My favorite dino might possibly be the Apatosaurus. Apto lived 150 million years ago and boasted an impressive 90-foot length with a 
        fast and ferocious tail. Computer simulations report it was rapid enough to break the sound barrier. 
        Some have argued that the motion would have damaged the tail and caused it to break after 
        just a few supersonic tail snaps.
